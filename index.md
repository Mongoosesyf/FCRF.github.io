## Abstract
Autonomous error correction is critical for domestic robots to achieve reliable execution of complex long-horizon tasks. Prior work has explored self-reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning error correction; however, existing methods are constrained by inflexible self-reflection mechanisms that limit their effectiveness. Motivated by these limitations and inspired by human cognitive adaptation, we propose the Flexible Constructivism Reflection Framework (FCRF), a novel Mentor-Actor architecture that enables LLMs to perform flexible self-reflection based on task difficulty, while constructively integrating historical valuable experience with failure lessons. We evaluated FCRF on diverse domestic tasks through simulation in AlfWorld and physical deployment in the real-world environment. Experimental results demonstrate that FCRF significantly improves overall performance and self-reflection flexibility in complex long-horizon robotic tasks.

## Methodology
The framework of FCRF. The planning process is executed by the Actor LLM, the reflection process is executed by the Mentor LLM. During
the self-reflection process, the difficulty level of the task is first assessed, according to which the Mentor flexibly selects reflection intensity, determine the proportion of simple experience retain and in-depth failure lessons extraction among all the reflection episodes. Combining the valuable experience and failure lesson, the Mentor performs a constructivism self-reflection to guide the next round of planning of the Actor. The reflection results and planning trajectories will be stored in the memory module for long-term management.
